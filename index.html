 <h2>Sequoyah Simmons</h2>
 <p>[My name is Sequoyah Simmons. I am a 23 year undergraduate student at The University of the West Indies, currently pursuing a degree
   in Information Technology. I am also a teacher, I teach Information Technology and Spanish at the primary level. My favourite colour is
   blue. I have two white toy dogs. I enjoy singing and going to the beach. I am interested in web development because it is intriguing. 
   I would love to learn more about making websites, as I have done a bit of html at college.]</p>
